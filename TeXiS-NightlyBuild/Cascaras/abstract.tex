\section*{Game engine and editor 2D for non-programmers}

Video game development is a field that has undergone significant evolution over the years. Initially, video games were simple programs designed to entertain players, but over time, they have evolved in complexity and scope. Today, video game development involves the creation of interactive virtual worlds that can span a wide variety of genres and platforms, from mobile games to high-end console and PC titles.

In our project, we address the challenge of simplifying the video game development process for people inexperienced in programming and development. This involves studying in depth what a videogame is, how they are created, the different 2D videogame engines available and their architectures, as well as the different ways of programming the behavior of the game elements. All this with the aim of designing an editor and a game engine that make the creation of games accessible and easy to understand for those who have no experience in the field.


This allows a wider group of people to create their own games and unleash their creativity without the barrier of complex programming.
